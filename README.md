***Project objective:*** *Design and development of an economical, next-generation CPR training manikin*

**My contributions:**
* Performed analytical and experimental stiffness calculations of springs, and also calculated their fatigue properties
* Studied the viscoelastic behavior of the human chest during a CPR process and compared them with my calculations, thus,
identifying the limitations of conventional manikin
* Used foams to impart damping characteristics to the manikin based on reliability, cost, and ease of assembly and repair
* Used an Indentation Force Deflection machine and a Sinusoidal Displacement Exciter to measure the dynamic properties, damping
coefficient, and transmissibility of a variety of foam specimens and select the appropriate one
* Designed a novel CPR manikin incorporating a nested spring structure, a foam casing, a chest cover with rib-like extensions, and a
tactile clicker together with a rate monitor to provide real-time compression depth and frequency feedback to the user
* The project was one of the 10 projects (top 5%) to be nominated for the Best Bachelor's Thesis award among ~200 projects
